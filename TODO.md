# Todo

- Track https://github.com/hseeberger/akka-http-json/issues/204

- `[B]` option (more explicit) works, but `[A]` (unmarshalling directly to `Source[Data,NotUsed]` does not. Help appreciated to figure out, why not.

  Note that Akka HTTP docs mention both of the use cases; thus it would make sense to offer support for both, if we can.
